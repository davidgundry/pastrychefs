# Pastry Chefs

Pastry Chefs is a 4-player card game that developed by David Gundry. Teams compete to bake as many pastries as they can.

The development of the game was the result of extensive playtesting to create enjoyable `whole' game that also elicits a specific kind of linguistic data.

## Research Background

I developed the game as part of my PhD research into designing games for eliciting human-subject data. The game is designed to elicit linguistic data in a naturalistic context without biasing its production. It is targetted to elicit a specific syntactic feature of English called the [dative alternation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dative_shift). I began an empirical study with promosing initial results, but for economical reasons switched my research to using the single player digital game [Adjective Game](https://adjectivegame.gatsbyjs.io). This game is mentioned (briefly) [in my PhD thesis](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/31655/) (See chapter 7, or search `Pastry Chefs').
